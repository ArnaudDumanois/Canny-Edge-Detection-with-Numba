# Canny-Edge-Detection-with-Numba

## Black and White transformation

The first step  of the project, consist in transform the image in black and white. 

- [ ] Check the version of the Code, if he fit with the number of channels of the image

## Gaussian blur

The second step of the project, consist in apply a gaussian blur to the image.

- [ ] Enhanced architecture of the code
- [ ] Fix sanitizer error, ask to the teacher

## Sobel Filter

The third step of the project, consist in apply the sobel filter to the image.

## Thresholding

The fourth step of the project, we need to find the potential edges based on thresholds


## Hysterisis Thresholding

The fifth step of the project, we need to find the edges based on the hysteresis thresholding
